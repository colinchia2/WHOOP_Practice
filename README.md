# WHOOP_Practice
A practice data pipeline for sleep &amp; steps data alongside some health bio marker analysis

PROJECT: WHOOP Practice - Sleep, Steps, Calories, and Blood Markers Analysis

PURPOSE: Demonstrate ability to use Snowflake, SQL, and Looker with WHOOP-like data
I will make use of advanced querying, table joins, creating VIEWS, CTEs, and Window Functions 

I have downloaded free FitBit data on sleep and steps from 30 random users, as well as
a separate blood collection database with 100 patients from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center
    FitBit Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit?resource=download-directory
    MIMIC-III Source: https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii-demo/1.4/

You can find my Snowflake Data script in the above folder too.
