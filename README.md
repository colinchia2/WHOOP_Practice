# WHOOP_Practice
A practice data pipeline for sleep &amp; steps data alongside some health bio marker analysis


PROJECT: WHOOP Practice - Sleep, Steps, Calories, and Blood Markers Analysis

PURPOSE: Demonstrate ability to use Snowflake, SQL, and Looker with WHOOP-like data
I will make use of advanced querying, table joins, creating VIEWS, CTEs, and Window Functions 

I have downloaded free FitBit data on sleep and steps from 30 random users, as well as
a separate blood collection database with 100 patients from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center
